# AmmoBoxAscended

No more manually filling turrets! The Ammo Box from Ark: Survival Evolved is now in Ark: Survival Ascended.

Following rules apply:

Can only place 2 within 10 foundations
1 minute refill timer
30 minute refill timer if the turret has shot at anything.
 

Turret reload timer can now be set by server owners.  Add the following to your GameUserSettings.ini flie:

[AmmoBoxAscended]
TurretRefillTimer = XXX (time is in seconds.  Default is 60 Seconds.)

There is still a 30 minute cooldown if the turret has been fired.

 

Planned features include:

Customizable fill distance
New Mesh
Popup that shows ammo inventory without having to open the box.
